# Calendar Challenge

## How to Use

A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

The app:

* Displays the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Presents timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allows a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Saves the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persists events between refreshes of a page
